Overview
This repository contains a simulation of Bitcoin mining. Miners solve a cryptographic puzzle using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to create a valid hash that meets the network's difficulty requirement. This simulation mimics the mining process and showcases how miners find a valid nonce.

Medium Post
Iâ€™ve also written a detailed article about Bitcoin Mining and this simulation on Medium. The article goes into depth about the mining process, the Proof of Work system, and how this Python code demonstrates the concept of mining.

Features
SHA-256 Hashing: Simulates the hashing process using Python's hashlib.

Configurable Difficulty: Adjust the mining difficulty by changing the number of leading zeros in the hash.

Transaction Simulation: Mimics the process of adding transactions to a block before mining
